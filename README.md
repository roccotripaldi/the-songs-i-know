## The Songs I Know

This is a super simple WordPress theme designed to display three page templates:

1. A list of songs on the home page
1. A single song's lyrics
1. A form allowing someone to request a song

This theme was designed for and by Rocco Tripaldi. It provides Rocco's captive audiences with a tool to
request songs for Rocco to play immediately, or to request Rocco learn a song in the future.
